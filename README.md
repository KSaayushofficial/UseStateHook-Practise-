##README: Understanding the useState Hook in React

📌 Introduction:
The useState hook is a fundamental React Hook that allows functional components to manage state. It is commonly used to store and update values within a component without requiring a class-based structure.

⚡ Installation:
Before using useState, ensure that React is installed in your project. You can install it using:

npm install react
or
yarn add react

🚀 Usage:
import { useState } from "react";

function ExampleComponent() {
  // Declare a state variable and a function to update it
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default ExampleComponent;
Explanation:
useState(0): Initializes state with a value of 0.
count: The state variable holding the current value.
setCount: The function used to update the state.
onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}: Updates the state when the button is clicked.

🔄 Updating State
Updating State with a Function
To ensure you always get the latest state value, update it using a function:
setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);
📝 Managing Complex State (Objects & Arrays)
useState can also manage objects and arrays.

Example with an Object:
const [user, setUser] = useState({ name: "John", age: 25 });

const updateAge = () => {
  setUser(prevUser => ({ ...prevUser, age: prevUser.age + 1 }));
};
Example with an Array:
javascript
Copy
Edit
const [items, setItems] = useState(["Apple", "Banana"]);

const addItem = () => {
  setItems([...items, "Orange"]);
};

⚠️ Important Notes
State updates are asynchronous – Avoid relying on state values directly after setting them.
State updates should be immutable – Always create a new object/array instead of modifying the existing one.
State persists across renders – The component re-renders whenever the state updates.
🎯 When to Use useState
✅ When a component needs to track dynamic values (e.g., form inputs, counters, toggles).
✅ When a component doesn’t require complex state logic (otherwise, consider useReducer).
✅ When working inside functional components instead of class components.

🛠 Example: Toggle Feature Using useState
javascript
Copy
Edit
function ToggleButton() {
  const [isOn, setIsOn] = useState(false);

  return (
    <button onClick={() => setIsOn(prev => !prev)}>
      {isOn ? "ON" : "OFF"}
    </button>
  );
}
🎯 Conclusion
The useState hook is an essential part of modern React development, allowing functional components to manage local state efficiently. It simplifies state management and enhances component reusability.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

📌 useState Hook in React:

📖 Overview
The useState hook is a built-in React hook that allows functional components to manage state. It provides a way to store, update, and handle local component state without needing class components.

📥 Installation:
Ensure that React is installed in your project before using useState.

npm install react
or
yarn add react

🚀 Usage:
useState initializes a state variable with a default value.
It returns an array containing the current state and a function to update it.
The state updates trigger re-renders in the component.

🔄 Updating State:
React state updates are asynchronous.
Use functional updates when modifying state based on the previous value.
Always ensure immutability when working with objects or arrays.

⚠️ Important Notes:
State persists across renders – Component re-renders when the state updates.
State updates should be immutable – Always create new copies of objects/arrays instead of modifying existing ones.
Multiple state variables can be used – Helps manage different types of data efficiently.

🎯 When to Use useState:
✅ When a component needs to track dynamic values (e.g., form inputs, counters, toggles).
✅ When a component doesn’t require complex state logic (otherwise, consider useReducer).
✅ When working inside functional components instead of class components.
